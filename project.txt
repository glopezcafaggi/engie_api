project:

Engie -  Wind turbine Energy prediction output and monitoring - api

Study Case :
In the scope of Engie green Energy transition goals for 2030, we propose a fully functional api for 
wind turbine Energy forecast through weather data. 


Objective:
-api for technical staff in the forecast of Energy production and wind farm localization.


Data:
Data from 4 wind turbines from Engie La-Haute Borne,France wind farm.
Consisting in sensor data from the wind turbine itself ans outside wheather conditions.

(Currently, the link is unavailable, however data is available in other public repositories.)

Model:
We propose to design a convolutional neural network in the context of time series regression for the variable
Active power (kW) (and possibly other internal sensor data).


API:
- user friendly api for technical staff.
- input weather conditions -> output temporamlly active power.
- visualisation interface.
- save/load to SQL database of prediction/tests.


Dev:
- python
- flask
- PostgreSQL
