## Case study

The European Comission aims for concrete goals for 2030 regarding climate targets, energy efficiency, renewable energy and overall sustainability,
through active policy proposals that shape the research and industry parnorama. [Link text](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/overall-targets-and-reporting/2030-targets_en)

 With a clear objective of europe's transition with and a 2% annual reduction of emissions between 2020 and 2030, the overall ambition of Net Zero carbonn for 2050 is at risk, as it is estimated that "70% of the techonologies to achieve its stated targets have not yey reached sufficeint maturity."

Wind energy is a core componenet of the energy transition. Today it represents 837 GW of global installed capacity with an uplift  of 12.4% over 2020, according to he Global wind Energy Council.

Engie share a vision in the scenario of decarbonization with clear goals by 2045. The strategy is involves:
- a growth investment of 22 to 25 billions euros for 2023-25, of which 70% will be allocated to Renewables and Energy Solutions.
- a balanced and diversified energy mix. a growth in invesment in onshore and offshore wind and solar energy.
 -  38 GW in 2022, 50 GW in 2025 and 80 GW in 2030 of additional capacity.

In the belgian landscape, the installed capacity includes 787 MW of renewable energy, where 
- 586 MW onshore wind
- 112 MW solar energy
- 22 MW hydroelectricity 
The ambitions for 2030 include the developping of 1,000 MW (from 586MW) of onshore wind power and 300 MW of through solar panels.

Alone, at 2024 the capacity of 586 MW equates to an annual production of 2 billion kilewatt hours per year, of enough power to support 570,000 families.


To achive this objectives, Engie Belgium aims to expand facilities by 40 MW per year and replace smaller, older turbines with more efficient examples.

Fact of wind turbines:
- 3 - 4 years from the consultation phaseto the commissioning of a wind farm.
- A well-placed turbine on land with a capacity of 3 MW can produce around 7,000 MWh of electricty in a year, able to support almost 2,000 families.
- the Life span of a turbine is 20 years.

About wind turbines: 
- starts working with a wind speed of 3 m/s(cut-in speed), it reaches maximuns capacity at 12 m/s and it shut down at 25 m/s (cut-out speed), for safety reasons. To shut down, each turbine can control the nacelle direction(yawning) as well as the blade angles(furling). This is explained in the power curve.

- Only a fraction of the wind power can be absorbed by the turbine [Link text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine#Efficiency).
- off shore turbines produce more, they are bigger. 
- inshore turbines currently offer a capacity of 3.5 to 5.6 MW and supplies its full capacity over an equivalent of 2,000 hours.(25% of the time)
